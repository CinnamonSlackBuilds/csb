NOTES
=====================

1. I'm using the latest Slackware release as base (currently 14.1).

2. PAM is needed to build several core packages of cinnamon. I have
   tried to avoid this, but it seems to be inevitable.

3. I tried to avoid systemd on this repository, thus some packages
   are still using older version. So far, it works.

4. I avoid changing/upgrading Slackware's glib packages which is
   required by some packages. There *might* be some issues caused
   by usage of older glib version. Let me know if i miss anything.

5. This scripts are tested on VM environment only!!

NOTES
=====================

1. I'm using the latest Slackware release as base (currently 14.1).

2. PAM is needed to build several core packages of cinnamon. I have
   tried to avoid this, but it seems to be inevitable.

3. I tried to avoid systemd on this repository, thus some packages
   are still using older version. So far, it works.

4. I avoid changing/upgrading Slackware's glib packages which is
   required by some packages. There *might* be some issues caused
   by usage of older glib version. Let me know if i miss anything.

5. This scripts are tested on VM environment only!!

6. Pulseaudio script will add UID/GID 216 to your system automatically
   if it doesn't exist yet. This is the UID/GID assigned according
   to SBo. I added this on the script to make the build script can
   run without any intervention at all during building.

7. Some code in cinnamon packages are hardcoded to /usr/lib, so even
   in x86_64, they will be installed in /usr/lib to avoid breakage.

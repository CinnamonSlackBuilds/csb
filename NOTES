NOTES
=====================

1. I'm using the latest Slackware release as base (currently 15.0).

2. I tried to avoid systemd on this repository. So far, it worked.

3. Some code in cinnamon packages are hardcoded to /usr/lib, so even
   in x86_64, they will be installed in /usr/lib to avoid breakage.

4. I removed webkit-related screensaver in cinnamon-screensaver to avoid
   building webkitgtk which is very time consuming. It still has the
   default screensaver that is able to lock your desktop.

5. By default, preferred application used for opening directory is incorrectly
   set to Audacious. To fix it, run the following commands
   xdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory
   xdg-mime default nemo.desktop application/x-directory

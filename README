CINNAMON SlackBuilds
=====================

This repository provides SlackBuild scripts to build and install the CINNAMON
desktop environment (http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com) on top of Slackware Linux.
The Cinnamon packages are built with a minimum set of dependencies, but still
provides a working desktop.

I do not plan to provide binary packages at this moment. The reason is that
because i only tested this on VM (virtual machine) environment only, not yet
on a real machine. Once it's confirmed that it works out-of-the-box in real
machine, then i can consider providing binary packages for Cinnamon.
As always, building from the source is the recommended way to make sure it
is linked with the libraries available on your machine.

How to build and install the CINNAMON packages using these scripts:

1.  Clone the Git repo or download a tarball/zip of the repo.

2.  You may want to read NOTES before building

3.  Install bash-completion from /extra before building the packages.

4.  Run libtest.sh script in test-script directory as root to make sure your
    libraries are not corrupted. These errors are safe and can be ignored:
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/htmlview': No such file or directory
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/krdb': No such file or directory
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/pnmnoraw': No such file or directory
    lddlibc4: cannot read header from `/usr/bin/pnmtoplainpnm': No such file or directory
    If you get a result of Invalid ELF header, that means one of your libraries
    are corrupted and must be fixed first before building this packages.

5.  Run the 'build-cinnamon.sh' in the root directory which will build
    and install all the cinnamon packages including the necessary dependencies.
    Just in case the automated build script failed, refer to KNOWN_ISSUES.
    If you want to build it manually, please refer to BUILD_ORDER

6.  Once the packages are built and installed, you can use 'xwmconfig' 
    to select the cinnamon session. Run startx to start Cinnamon Desktop.

7.  Enjoy and let me know of any issues or suggestions/improvements.

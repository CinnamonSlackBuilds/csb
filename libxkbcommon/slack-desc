# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

libxkbcommon:
libxkbcommon: libxkbcommon is a keymap compiler and support library which processes
libxkbcommon: a reduced subset of keymaps as defined by the XKB specification.
libxkbcommon: Primarily, a keymap is created from a set of
libxkbcommon: Rules/Model/Layout/Variant/Options names, processed through an
libxkbcommon: XKB ruleset, and compiled into a struct xkb_keymap, which is
libxkbcommon: the base type for all xkbcommon operations.
libxkbcommon:
libxkbcommon: libxkbcommon does not distribute a dataset itself, other than for
libxkbcommon: testing purposes.

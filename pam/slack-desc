pam: pam (Pluggable Authentication Modules)
pam:
pam: PAM = Pluggable Authentication Modules.  Basically, it is a flexible
pam: mechanism for authenticating users.  PAM provides a way to develop
pam: programs that are independent of authentication scheme.  However,
pam: these programs will need "authentication modules" (and libpam) at
pam: run-time in order to work.
